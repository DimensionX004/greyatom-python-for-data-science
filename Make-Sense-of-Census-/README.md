### Project Overview

 It is a good representation of how to manipulate huge data.


### Learnings from the project

 It was quite a challenging one for me as I am a beginner in this field.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The instruction was provided by the course which I am pursuing. Some more help was gathered from the internet.


### Challenges faced

 Some of the places the information was not properly given by the course, there I faced difficulties.


### Additional pointers

 Concept of the array will become hugely clear from this project.
